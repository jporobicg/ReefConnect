# ReefConnect

ReefConnect is a Python package for calculating connectivity kernels in the Great Barrier Reef. It provides tools for analyzing reef connectivity through angle calculations, connectivity matrices, and kernel generation.

## Features

- Calculate angles between reef positions
- Compute connectivity matrices for reef networks

### Connectivity Estimation Method

To estimate the connectivity among the 3800 sites, we applied a hybrid approach combining full-sample calculation with bootstrap resampling:

1. **Full-sample connectivity matrix**:  
   We used all available particles (1000 per site) to compute a 3800 Ã— 3800 connectivity matrix, which represents the best estimate of particle-mediated connections across the system.

2. **Bootstrap uncertainty analysis**:  
   To assess variability and confidence in the connectivity estimates, we applied bootstrap resampling. For each bootstrap iteration, particles were resampled with replacement at each site, and a new connectivity matrix was computed. The process was repeated 100 times to generate a distribution of connectivity values for each matrix element.

This approach provides both a robust estimate of connectivity and an assessment of the reliability of each connection. Confidence intervals and standard deviations can be derived from the bootstrap ensemble to identify stable versus uncertain pathways in the system.

- Generate connectivity kernels
- Support for various connectivity parameters and thresholds

## Installation

To install ReefConnect, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install reefconnect
```

This will install the package and its dependencies.
